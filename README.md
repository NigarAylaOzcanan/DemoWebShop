# DemoWebShop.com Testing Project

### Project Overview

This project is aimed at testing various functionalities of a web store using Selenium and TestNG. The web store under test is [DemoWebShop](https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/).

## User Stories Covered

**User Registration (US 201):** This user story involves the ability for users to register on the web store platform. Registration enables users to create an account, which grants them access to features like shopping, order tracking, and personalized recommendations.

**Negative Registration (US 202):** This user story focuses on handling error scenarios during user registration. Specifically, it addresses the situation where a user tries to register with an email address that is already associated with an existing account. Providing clear error messages in such cases enhances the user experience by guiding them appropriately.

**Logout (US 203):** This user story revolves around the capability for users to securely log out from their accounts on the web store platform. Logging out ensures the safety of the user's account and personal information, especially if they are accessing the platform from shared or public devices.

**Negative Login (US 205):** Similar to US 202, this user story pertains to handling error scenarios, but during the login process. It involves testing various negative scenarios, such as incorrect credentials or account lockouts, to ensure that the login mechanism is robust and secure against unauthorized access.

**Ordering (US 206):** This user story deals with the functionality for users to place orders for products available on the web store platform. It typically involves selecting items, adding them to a cart, providing payment details (such as credit card information), and completing the purchase process.

**Survey Response (US 207):** This user story relates to the feature allowing users to participate in surveys or polls hosted on the web store platform. It includes functionalities such as answering survey questions and viewing survey results. The user experience is enhanced by providing appropriate warnings or prompts, such as requiring users to log in before participating in surveys.

**Negative Coupon/Gift Card Usage (US 208):** Similar to US 202 and US 205, this user story focuses on handling error scenarios, specifically related to the usage of coupons and gift cards during the shopping process. It involves displaying alert messages when users attempt to apply invalid or nonexistent coupons or gift cards, improving the overall customer experience.

**Download Order History (US 209):** This user story addresses the need for users to view and download their order history from the web store platform. It enables users to track their past purchases, review order details, and obtain order documents (such as invoices or receipts), thereby facilitating better management of their shopping  activities.
